Intelligent Vehicle Tracking (IVTR) : An IoT and TinyML based solution towards detecting Violations of Traffic Rules

This project aims to develop an intelligent vehicle tracking system that can help detect traffic violations of some important road traffic rules. Some of these well-experienced traffic violations are dangerous driving, over speeding, smoky exhaust, honking, etc. We propose to use cutting-edge technologies such as IoT, LoRaWAN, and TinyML for the said purpose to minimize the cost and complexity (computing and communication) and maximize accuracy, adaptability, and scalability.
